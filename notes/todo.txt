BEFORE LAUNCH:

- link from google to event redirect should be blogroll showing one page, maybe text description?
-- add find-more-events link to make it clear how to search for more
- everyone else should just redirect to fb page

- logged out page shows all events, somehow highlight location selector
- hover-overs for event selectors

- rankings view, organize by country?

- figure out how to simplify signup page to top right? make the signup link (if not yet registered) ask a couple follow-up questions prefilled...?

- maybe add optional links for large flyers?


- support non-facebook login via http://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/registration ?

- add comments via http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/comments
- or via graph.facebook.com/event/feed on http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/event

- for timezones, use "must be within same country" rule
- attending counts on dancedeets
- set filters on a per event type basis?
- do a better logged out experience. no need to log in to use the site.

- Do something about the emails so that people in lesser-activity
areas get emailed less frequently, and only when necessary. Or stick
with weekly-on-wednesday emails for now?

- rss feed
- use search-system to page through all-events periodically, using title-keywords (trained? something else? to identify new events) http://developers.facebook.com/docs/api
- somehow expose all-upcoming-events-in-the-world view: a la http://www.dancedeets.com/?user_location=Katowice,+Poland&distance=10000&distance_units=miles&freestyle=FREESTYLE_DANCER&choreo=CHOREO_DANCER
- train system to identify dance events versus not. use negative keywords to filter out salsa/lindy stuff.
http://code.google.com/apis/predict/docs/getting-started.html
http://code.google.com/apis/storage/docs/getting-started.html
- get rid of club events maybe? or second category that must be manually added? untrainable?
- use list-of-attendees as a classifier in training event types as well. good for choreo hiphop.
- maybe build system for "area leaders". they can approve/updaate/change events in their area. fix geocodes. nice admin-overview page, status of number-of-people, events to process

- attach youtube videos of the events
- add keywords per event. use them to look up videos, maybe with upload times <6months after event (to catch "yearly" event problems)
- build an event classifier to autoclassify videos as dance videos or not

- Handle XSRF properly

- groupon emails as an example of call-to-action emails

- Revisit emails:
- add rankings in right-hand-column
- add call-to-action in right-hand-column

- "Want to do better?" links from rankings page to promote to fb friends
- track email-redirects to see who reads emails

- add rankings of more types to the rankings page, perhaps by splitting up the rankings page
- send daily email of http://www.dancedeets.com/events/admin_potential_events
- "Post this to your wall?" after rsvp-ing for an event. Promo for DanceDeets via "Dolapo found Yoruba Dance Sessions on DanceDeets"
- share-event-on-facebook link. http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/fql/permissions and http://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/attachments and publich_stream attachment
- Send messages via fb not email. Perhaps using fan pages?

LAUNCH PLAN:
- Post on my facebook every other day, at different times of day.
- Post on friends' walls who haven't signed up yet. Work my way up to the dancers that I know less.
- Try to reach people who promote events. search email for "invited you to". carlo, cj, char, jon malave, joanne, (conrad and voodoo?), shoey (nyc choreo scene?), agatha, robnasty, vienna, phoenix, main stacks, thecompany, main ingredient, inhumanoids, open house, allthewaylive, eric groove, francis llave, sandy lee, dennis infante, 
- Post on tumblr and get friends to reblog it.
- Email onecypher, mindbodyflo, firstclass arts, movement lifestyle, etc
- Post on boogiezone, westcoastpoppin, bboyworld, bboy.org, breakernyc, streetdance.cz, etc.
- Create flyers, hand out in NYC, SF, everywhere I go.
- Create facebook advertisements

LONGER TERM:
- embed widget
- Add some stats on "users that see a given event", to make a compelling case for promoters to put events on this site.
- Some way to find users who have created events, and directly incite them to add to dance deets?
- allow override on timezone/scene/etc for users where we get it wrong

- music venues, good events, using classifier
- going through theater, arts, live music, etc
- programmer-tech-meet-up events

- video hosting, use youtube+vimeo apis to aggregate. group by event, by performer, by group, etc
- live streaming events with kyte, aggregate for others to virtually 'attend'
- simple mobile apps around html-frames
