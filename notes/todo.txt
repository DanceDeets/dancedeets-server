BEFORE LAUNCH:

- Do something about the emails so that people in lesser-activity
areas get emailed less frequently, and only when necessary. Or stick
with weekly-on-wednesday emails for now?

- embed widget

- "Want to do better?" links from rankings page to promote to fb friends
- track conversion via email redirect links
- track conversion on homepage, by user?
- send daily email of http://www.dancedeets.com/events/admin_potential_events
- "Post this to your wall?" after rsvp-ing for an event. Promo for DanceDeets via "Dolapo found Yoruba Dance Sessions on DanceDeets"
- In emails include rankings, with call-to-action.
- Send messages via fb not email. Perhaps using fan pages?

LAUNCH PLAN:
- Post on my facebook every other day, at different times of day.
- Post on friends' walls who haven't signed up yet. Work my way up to the dancers that I know less.
- Try to reach people who promote events. search email for "invited you to". carlo, cj, char, jon malave, joanne, (conrad and voodoo?), shoey (nyc choreo scene?), agatha, robnasty, vienna, phoenix, main stacks, thecompany, main ingredient, inhumanoids, open house, allthewaylive, eric groove, francis llave, sandy lee, dennis infante, 
- Post on tumblr and get friends to reblog it.
- Email onecypher, mindbodyflo, firstclass arts, movement lifestyle, etc
- Post on boogiezone, westcoastpoppin, bboyworld, bboy.org, breakernyc, streetdance.cz, etc.
- Create flyers, hand out in NYC, SF, everywhere I go.
- Create facebook advertisements

LONGER TERM:
- rss feed
- Maybe cleanup homepage more with better text/images.
- Add some stats on "users that see a given event", to make a
compelling case for promoters to put events on this site.
- Some way to find users who have created events, and directly incite them to add to dance deets?
- Support read-only mode in the datastore by handling these things gracefully. hard to test??

- allow override on timezone/scene/etc for users where we get it wrong
