BEFORE LAUNCH:

- Do something about the emails so that people in lesser-activity
areas get emailed less frequently, and only when necessary. Or stick
with weekly-on-wednesday emails for now?

- embed widget

- Handle XSRF properly

- attach youtube videos of the events
- groupon emails as an example of call-to-action emails

- Revisit emails:
- add rankings in right-hand-column
- add call-to-action in right-hand-column

- "Want to do better?" links from rankings page to promote to fb friends
- track email-redirects to see who reads emails

- add rankings of more types to the rankings page, perhaps by splitting up the rankings page
- send daily email of http://www.dancedeets.com/events/admin_potential_events
- "Post this to your wall?" after rsvp-ing for an event. Promo for DanceDeets via "Dolapo found Yoruba Dance Sessions on DanceDeets"
- share-event-on-facebook link. http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/fql/permissions and http://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/attachments and publich_stream attachment
- Send messages via fb not email. Perhaps using fan pages?

LAUNCH PLAN:
- Post on my facebook every other day, at different times of day.
- Post on friends' walls who haven't signed up yet. Work my way up to the dancers that I know less.
- Try to reach people who promote events. search email for "invited you to". carlo, cj, char, jon malave, joanne, (conrad and voodoo?), shoey (nyc choreo scene?), agatha, robnasty, vienna, phoenix, main stacks, thecompany, main ingredient, inhumanoids, open house, allthewaylive, eric groove, francis llave, sandy lee, dennis infante, 
- Post on tumblr and get friends to reblog it.
- Email onecypher, mindbodyflo, firstclass arts, movement lifestyle, etc
- Post on boogiezone, westcoastpoppin, bboyworld, bboy.org, breakernyc, streetdance.cz, etc.
- Create flyers, hand out in NYC, SF, everywhere I go.
- Create facebook advertisements

LONGER TERM:
- rss feed
- Add some stats on "users that see a given event", to make a compelling case for promoters to put events on this site.
- Some way to find users who have created events, and directly incite them to add to dance deets?
- allow override on timezone/scene/etc for users where we get it wrong

- music venues, good events, using classifier
- going through theater, arts, live music, etc
- programmer-tech-meet-up events

- video hosting, use youtube+vimeo apis to aggregate. group by event, by performer, by group, etc
- live streaming events with kyte, aggregate for others to virtually 'attend'
- simple mobile apps around html-frames
