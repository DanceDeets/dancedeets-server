BEFORE LAUNCH:

- fix up mapreduce to use k=v params, and then in parsers
- add dummy inviter-field, and use it as well for grouping

- fix up sign in flow to remember user's preferences

- keep sign-in button, but if user clicks it and fb account is not registered, re-use the sign-up form on a standalone page

- build an invite flow that tracks original-inviting-user token

- don't worry about splitting users/events by city for now, just stick it in one huge mapreduce state. later we can do multiple runs that grab a portion of cities, or have a second fixup script that uses the mapreduce state to produce good output on a per-city basis


- Do something about the emails so that people in lesser-activity
areas get emailed less frequently, and only when necessary. Or stick
with weekly-on-wednesday emails for now?

- twitter box
- jquery calendar
- embed widget

UI feedback of my own:
- "Want to do better?" links from rankings page to promote to fb friends
- track conversion via email redirect links
- send daily email of http://www.dancedeets.com/events/admin_potential_events

UI feedback from partychat:
- "Dolapo found Yoruba Dance Sessions on DanceDeets" posting to facebook, if using dancedeets to rsvp?
- "Post this to your wall?" after rsvp-ing for an event. Promo for DanceDeets

UI feedback from martina:
- make these settings permanent, perhaps autodetecting repeat changes?

UI feedback from Ian:
- list "workshop, performance" next to events

Get rid of much of the footer.

LAUNCH PLAN:
- Post on my facebook every other day, at different times of day.
- Post on friends' walls who haven't signed up yet. Work my way up to the dancers that I know less.
- Try to reach people who promote events. search email for "invited you to". carlo, cj, char, jon malave, joanne, (conrad and voodoo?), shoey (nyc choreo scene?), agatha, robnasty, vienna, phoenix, main stacks, thecompany, main ingredient, inhumanoids, open house, allthewaylive, eric groove, francis llave, sandy lee, dennis infante, 
- Post on tumblr and get friends to reblog it.
- Email onecypher, mindbodyflo, firstclass arts, movement lifestyle, etc
- Post on boogiezone, westcoastpoppin, bboyworld, bboy.org, breakernyc, streetdance.cz, etc.
- Create flyers, hand out in NYC, SF, everywhere I go.
- Create facebook advertisements

LONGER TERM:
- rss feed
- Maybe cleanup homepage more with better text/images.
- Add some stats on "users that see a given event", to make a
compelling case for promoters to put events on this site.
- Some way to find users who have created events, and directly incite them to add to dance deets?
- Support read-only mode in the datastore by handling these things gracefully. hard to test??

- allow override on timezone/scene/etc for users where we get it wrong
